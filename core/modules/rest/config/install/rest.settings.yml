# Before Drupal 8.2, EntityResource used permissions as well as the entity
# access system for access checking. This was confusing, and it only did this
# for historical reasons. New Drupal installations opt out from this by default
# (hence this is set to false), existing installations opt in to it.
# @see rest_update_8203()

# You must install Hal and Basic_auth modules for this to work. Also, if you are
# going to use Basic_auth in a production environment then you should consider
# setting up SSL.
# There are alternatives to Basic_auth in contrib such as OAuth module.
